# IDS & SCSU Hackathon Feb. 2024 Challenge 2 - Raster Overlay Trimming

## Team: *Team Rocket*
 - Brendan Kariniemi, Rylan Loukusa

## Challenge Description
Currently, the IDS team performs a lot of operations manually that we need to automate to become a true Platform as a Service (PaaS) company for digital twins. One such operation is trimming raster overlay imagery. For example, if a client has a floor plan PDF they would like available as a map overlay, we donâ€™t want the entire pdf to be shown on the map with whitespace all around it, we want to trim the white space and match the floor plan outline. We would like this to be an automated process that happens once a plan is uploaded to our platform.
